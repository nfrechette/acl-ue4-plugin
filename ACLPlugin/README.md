# ACL Plugin

This plugin integrates the [Animation Compression Library](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl) within Unreal Engine 4. It is suitable for all your animations and features a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and very fast compression and decompression.

See [here](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin) for details!

Note: the plugin releases on GitHub and on the Unreal Marketplace remove a few development only dependencies not required at runtime or within the editor.
