## Engine integration

Starting with UE 4.25, the engine natively supports an animation compression codec interface suitable for plugins. This allows the *ACL Plugin v1.0.0* (and up) to function as-is with no custom engine changes straight from the Unreal Marketplace or from GitHub. Here are the necessary steps in order to use the plugin directly from GitHub:

*  Clone the *develop* branch and its sub-modules with: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin.git`
*  Grab the `ACLPlugin` directory located here: [acl-ue4-plugin/ACLPlugin](../ACLPlugin) and copy it under `UE4 Root\Engine\Plugins` or in the plugin directory of your project.
*  Update the UE4 solution with the `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` or the equivalent file for your OS. The ACL plugin contains code that needs to be built for the editor and the runtime.
*  Open and build the editor.

Once you start the editor, you should see the ACL Plugin in the plugin list under `Edit -> Plugins` in the top menu bar. Make sure it is enabled for your project and reload the editor if needed.

*See [here](pre_4_25_integration.md) for further instructions when integrating the ACL Plugin in UE 4.24 and earlier.*

### How to use animation compression codecs in UE4

Compression codecs are data driven much like other assets in the engine. Animation sequences reference a `Bone Compression Settings` asset that can be created in the content browser by right-clicking and selecting it under the `Animation` category. A compression settings asset is responsible for referencing a list of codecs to try when compression is requested. Each codec is tried in parallel and the best one is selected by the same heuristic that the old `Automatic Compression` relied on (in UE 4.24 and earlier). The list of codecs that `Automatic Compression` used to reference can now be found in the default compression settings asset located under `Engine Content/Animation` (note that you will need enable the `Show Engine Content` option in the `View Options` to see it). It contains the same codecs that UE 4.24 and earlier used.

The ACL plugin also provides its own compression settings asset located in its plugin content folder (note that you will need to enable the `Show Plugin Content` option in the `View Options` to see it). It contains only the ACL codec and can be used out of the box in all your animation sequences.

### How to change the default compression codec

In order to change the default compression settings asset used, you will need to edit the `BaseEngine.ini` or the equivalent file in your project under the `[Animation.DefaultObjectSettings]` section. The relevant entry is this one: `BoneCompressionSettings="/Engine/Animation/DefaultAnimBoneCompressionSettings"`. It points to an asset under *Engine Content*. You can change it to point to any other suitable asset of your choice. You can also modify that asset to add ACL.

## Compression settings

All units are in centimeters (the UE4 default), and as such if you use different units you will need to change the default thresholds and values to take this into account.

ACL tries very hard to be as safe as possible and as such very few things require tuning. It is recommended to use the `Anim Compress ACL` codec which uses the optimal settings behind the scene. If you need more power or wish to explore, you can opt to use the `Anim Compress Custom ACL` codec which allows you to tweak everything.

### Anim Compress ACL

Internally, the optimal and recommended settings will be used. Very little tweaking is required and only the absolute minimum is exposed for simplicity and safety.

![Default ACL Options](Images/CompressionSettings_Default.png)

The ACL [error metric](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/blob/develop/docs/error_metrics.md) simulates virtual vertices at a fixed distance from each and every bone. This is meant to approximate the visual mesh. Choosing an appropriate value for the *Default Virtual Vertex Distance* is important. The default value of **3cm** is generally suitable for ordinary characters but large objects or exotic characters might require fine tuning. UE4 also has support for special bones that require more accuracy. By default, every bone that has a socket attached will be deemed as needing high accuracy as well as any bone that contains one of the substrings present in `UAnimationSettings::KeyEndEffectorsMatchNameArray`. Common substrings included are: *hand, eye, IK, camera, etc*. For those special bones, the *Safe Virtual Vertex Distance* is used instead.

The ACL optimization algorithm will attempt to aggressively remove everything it can until the error exceeds a specified *Error Threshold*. For this reason, the threshold is very important and it should be very conservative. A default value of **0.01cm** is appropriate for cinematographic quality and most likely does not require any tuning. The error threshold works in conjunction with the virtual vertex distance since the error is measured on the virtual vertices.

The compression level dictates how aggressively ACL tries to optimize the memory footprint. Higher levels will yield a smaller memory footprint but take longer to compress while lower levels will compress faster with a larger memory footprint. *Medium* strikes a good balance and is suitable for production use.

Despite the best efforts of ACL, some exotic animation sequences will end up having an unacceptably large error, and when this happens, it will attempt to fall back to safer settings. This should happen extremely rarely if the virtual vertex distances are properly tuned. In order to control this behavior, a threshold is provided to control when it kicks in (the behavior can be disabled if you set the threshold to **0.0**). As ACL improves over time, the fallback might become obsolete.

### Anim Compress ACL Custom

Using the custom codec allows you to tweak and control every aspect of ACL. These are provided mostly for debugging purposes. In production, it should never be needed but if you do find that to be the case, please reach out so that we can investigate and fix this issue. Note that as a result of supporting every option possible, decompression can often end up being a bit slower (less code is stripped by the compiler).

The default values are the ones being used by `Anim Compress ACL`.

#### ACL Options

![Custom ACL Options](Images/CompressionSettings_Custom_Options.png)

The ACL [error metric](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/blob/develop/docs/error_metrics.md) simulates virtual vertices at a fixed distance from each and every bone. This is meant to approximate the visual mesh and, as such, choosing an appropriate value for the *Default Virtual Vertex Distance* is important. The default value of **3cm** is generally suitable for ordinary characters but large objects or exotic characters might require fine tuning. UE4 also has support for special bones that require more accuracy.

#### Clip

![Custom clip options](Images/CompressionSettings_Custom_Clip.png)

This plugin supports three rotation formats: *Quat Full Bit Rate, Quat Drop W Full Bit Rate, and Quat Drop W Variable Bit rate (default)*. The variable bit rate is almost always the best choice which is why it is the default. The other two options are used by the safety fallback and for debugging purposes.

For translation and scale tracks, the plugin supports two vector formats: *Vector3 Full Bit Rate and Vector3 Variable Bit Rate (default)*. Here again the variable bit rate is the ideal choice and the other option is provided for debugging purposes.

Three boolean flags are provided to control the range reduction of each track type. These are provided for debugging purposes.

#### Segmenting

![Custom segmenting options](Images/CompressionSettings_Custom_Segmenting.png)

ACL splits animation sequences into smaller segments and compresses those independently. A boolean flag is provided to control this behavior but it rarely is a good idea to disable it.

Three boolean flags are also provided to control the per segment range reduction for debugging purposes.

Two values control how segments are partitioned: *Ideal Num Key Frames Per Segment and Max Num Key Frames Per Segment*. ACL will attempt to have segments of the ideal number of key frames while never exceeding the maximum value provided. The default values are sensible and should be suitable for everyday use.

## UE4 reports a high compression error, how come?

In rare cases UE4 can report a high compression error with the ACL plugin. To better understand why, make sure to read [how error is measured](error_measurements.md).

## ACL Plugin playground

In order to test and play with the ACL Plugin, a playground was created where every single animation from the [animation starter pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/animation-starter-pack) is playing simultaneously. A zip file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qHgKSbpFJEbJwvz-IzLiRc8Rewbj5lT_). Note that you will need to run it under UE 4.25 (or higher) with the ACL Plugin installed.
