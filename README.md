# Animation Compression Library Unreal Engine 4 Plugin

This plugin integrates the [Animation Compression Library](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl) version [v2-wip](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl) within [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog). It is suitable for every animation clip and platform as it features a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and very fast compression and decompression.

Compared to **UE 4.25.0**, the ACL plugin compresses up to **2.8x smaller**, is up to **4.6x more accurate**, up to **40x faster to compress**, and up to **5x faster to decompress** (results may vary depending on the platform and data).

The documentation on how to use it can be found [here](./Docs/README.md) along with performance results.

You can find the ACL plugin on the Unreal Marketplace [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/animation-compression-library).
