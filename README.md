# Animation Compression Library Unreal Engine 4 Plugin

This plugin integrates the [Animation Compression Library](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl) version [v1.1.0](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/releases/tag/v1.1.0) within [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog). It is suitable for every animation clip and platform as it features a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and very fast compression and decompression.

Compared to UE4, the plugin is **1.7x** smaller, **3x** more accurate, **2.5x** faster to compress, and up to **4.8x** faster to decompress!

The documentation on how to use it can be found [here](./Docs/README.md) along with performance results.

**NOTE: A refactor of the animation compression codecs scheduled for UE 4.23 will allow this plugin to be published on the Unreal Marketplace. Until then, it requires a few custom changes to the engine to work. The plugin code will be updated once the refactor becomes accessible to the public.**
